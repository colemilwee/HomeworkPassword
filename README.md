for this assignment i made a password generator how it works is that it'll prompt you at the start to pick a number between 8-128 using parseInt i can make sure there picking between 8-128 if not it'll re prompt them
i then use an arry for my confirmations to see if there true or not later in a function
i then make an while if statement for my 4 questions to randomize each part of it
